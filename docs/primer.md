# Test-negative design: primer

- What is VE
  - Known biases with any VE estimator
- What is a TND study
- There are 8 kinds of people:
  - Vaccinated vs. not
  - Infected with the focal pathogen vs. not
  - Seek a test vs. not
  - Test positive vs. not
- TND has access only to people who seek a test
- "Actual" VE is: [insert risk ratio math]
- TND estimator of VE is: [insert odds ratio math]
- Note that TND estimator is unbiased only when: [assumptions]
- Bias of TND estimator scales this way with underlying parameters: [discuss]
